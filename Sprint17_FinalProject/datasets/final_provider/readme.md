## Datasets

The dataset is comprised of four separate files, which were merged to create a complete customer profile:
* **`contract.csv`**: Information about the customer's contract type, payment method, monthly charges, and total charges. Also contains `BeginDate` and `EndDate`.
* **`personal.csv`**: Customer's demographic information (gender, age, partner, dependents).
* **`internet.csv`**: Details on the customer's internet service and add-ons (e.g., online security, tech support).
* **`phone.csv`**: Information on whether the customer has phone service.
